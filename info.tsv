1	income	Income and wealth	Income and wealth shape households’ consumption possibilities. Income after taxes and transfers indicates what households have available to spend, while direct measures of household consumption expenditure inform about “realised” material conditions (rather than possibilities). Wealth meanwhile provides a buffer that can help to smooth consumption and enable longer-term investments (such as in housing).
2	jobs	Work and job quality	Work refers to productive activity (whether paid or unpaid), and job quality is about both material and non-material aspects of people’s working conditions. Material aspects of working conditions include issues such as remuneration (e.g. salary), the availability of jobs, and the risk of job loss. Non-material aspects relate to the quality of the working environment, measured through workers’ self-reports about their physical safety, the content of their job, how well this matches their skills and abilities, the autonomy afforded, their learning opportunities, working time arrangements, and relationships with co-workers.
3	housing	Housing	Housing provides shelter, safety, privacy and personal space. The area where people live also determines their access to many different services. Different aspects of housing conditions include the quality of housing, housing affordability, and the amenities and characteristics of neighbourhoods.
4	balance	Work-life balance	Work-Life Balance is about being able to combine family commitments, leisure, and work.
5	health	Health	Health is about being and feeling well: a long life unencumbered by physical or mental illness, and the ability to participate in activities that people value.
6	education	Knowledge and skills	Knowledge and skills are about what people know and can do.
7	community	Social connections	Social Connections capture the quantity of social interactions (e.g., frequency and amount of time individuals spend with household members, their family, friends, colleagues, and other known persons), their quality (e.g. satisfaction with social interactions, perceived loneliness), and the support (e.g. emotional and financial) provided by these connections.
8	civic	Civic engagement	Civic Engagement is about whether people can and do take part in a range of important civic activities that enable them to shape the society they live in.
9	environment	Environmental quality	Environmental Quality affects human health through the quality of air, water and soil, which is related to the presence and density of hazardous substances. Environmental Quality also matters intrinsically to people who value natural beauty and the amenities that affect their life choices (e.g. a place to live). Finally, people benefit from environmental services and assets.
10	safety	Safety	Safety is about freedom from harm, whether that harm comes in the form of crime, conflict, violence, terrorism, oppression, accidents or natural disasters.
11	satisfaction	Subjective well-being	Subjective Well-being is about good mental states, and how people experience their lives.
